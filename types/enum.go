// This block of code defines a set of constants for different types of media formats. Each constant
// represents a specific media type and is assigned a string value that corresponds to the MIME type of
// that media format. These constants can be used in Go code to specify the media type of data being
// sent or received over the network, such as in HTTP headers.
